Dr. Yunxiao Shan, an Associate Professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence at Sun Yat-sen University. 
Yunxiao Shan graduated with a Master's degree from the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2010, and received his Ph.D. from Wuhan University in 2018. Between 2015 and 2016, he undertook joint training at the School of Computer Science, Rutgers University, USA. From 2018 to 2021, he conducted research on robotics at the Institute of Unmanned Systems, School of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University.

In terms of academia, he serves as an early career editorial board member of the SCI journal CMC - Computers Materials & Continua. He has published over 20 high-level papers, including in journals like JFR, TVT, ITS, TIV, TCSVT, etc. His deep research work involves planning and control of unmanned driving (mobile robots) facing uncertain environments and surface perception. He has received support for multiple national and provincial-level projects in the field of robotics, and the current contract amount exceeds 5 million.

## [Master/PhD Enrollment Notice] 

I warmly welcome students interested in robotics from interdisciplinary fields such as Mathematics, Automation, and Electro-Mechanics, not just from Computer Science. 

If you are considering applying for or being recommended for a Master's or PhD program at Sun Yat-Sen University, please contact me. 

When sending the email, please include your personal resume and undergraduate transcript for reference. 

## Undergraduate Recruitment Notice

Our research group is currently seeking undergraduate students in two main areas: 

1. **Uncertainty Mathematical Modeling and Transmission Mechanism Research:**
    - Requires basic knowledge of probability theory and other mathematical foundations.

2. **Research on Core Algorithms for Multi-Robot Collaborative Positioning:**
    - Requires knowledge of mathematical optimization and matrix operations.

We extend an invitation to undergraduate students who, whilst managing their regular studies:

- Have a strong interest in mathematics and don't shy away from the effort it takes to learn, understand, and derive formulas;
- And/or love coding, are fluent in any language, and have completed independent programming projects;

to join our research group. We are open to students across all years and majors. 

Even for those not based on the Zhuhai campus, our group can provide for travel costs between other campuses and Zhuhai, as well as accommodation expenses in Zhuhai. Outstanding performers might also be eligible for additional living allowances.

**Graduate Employment**: 
Our first batch of graduates have primarily found employment with leading companies such as Tencent, Li Auto, and numerous top-tier autonomous driving companies.
