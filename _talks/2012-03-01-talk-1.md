The report presented a planning method for expected functional safety protection of autonomous driving, considering the uncertainty of positioning. By implementing the integrated expression of positioning uncertainty and perception uncertainty in the grid map, the perception and positioning are represented in a unified space. Combined with the Frenet planner, the proposed method can achieve safe driving under various positioning uncertainties. The report also showed relevant experimental results and videos.
